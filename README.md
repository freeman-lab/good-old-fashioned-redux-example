# good-old-fashioned-redux-example

This reproduces one of the examples from the [`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) documentation, but using "good old fashioned javascript": no babel, no JSX, no webpack, minimal tooling, just modules and browserify. Similar to [`simplest-redux-example`](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example) but doesn't use babel / JSX / ES6. Also similar in style to [`tree-view`](https://github.com/maxogden/tree-view). You might find this useful if you want to play with the cool ideas behind these tools without adopting a bunch of new conventions.
