# good-old-fashioned-redux-example

This reproduces one of the examples from the [`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) documentation, but using "good old fashioned javascript": no babel, no JSX, no webpack, no tooling, just modules and browserify, with a little help from [`budo`](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo). Similar to [`simplest-redux-example`](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example) but **even simpler** because it drops the babel / JSX / ES6. You might find it useful if you want to play with the cool ideas behind these tools without immediately adopting a bunch of new conventions.
